# Optimization under Rare Chance Constraints  
## Systemic Tail Risk Analysis of AI Equity Portfolios

This repository contains an academic project developed in the context of the course  
**IFT-6512 – Programmation stochastique** (Université de Montréal).

The objective of this work is to analyze **systemic tail risk** in portfolios composed of
major Artificial Intelligence (AI) equities, using an optimization framework under **rare
chance constraints**, inspired by the methodology proposed in **Tong et al. (2022)**.



##  Project Overview

Classical portfolio optimization techniques (mean–variance, maximum return, diversification)
are known to perform poorly in extreme market conditions.  
This project investigates tail risk behavior by:

- Formulating portfolio optimization problems under **rare-event probability constraints**
- Approximating extreme loss probabilities using **large deviations theory**
- Identifying **dominant points**, i.e. the most likely market shocks generating extreme losses
- Comparing classical portfolios to a **VaR-oriented optimal allocation**

The analysis focuses deliberately on a **sectorially homogeneous universe (AI equities)** in
order to isolate and study **systemic risk mechanisms**.


##  Methodology

### Modeling assumptions
- Weekly log-returns modeled as a **multivariate Gaussian distribution**
- Parameters estimated empirically:
  - Mean vector
  - Covariance matrix, estimated using **Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage**
- Portfolio is **long-only** and fully invested

### Risk measures
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**
- **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)**
- Rare-event probability approximations using **first-order large deviations (P1)**

### Optimization problem
The core problem maximizes the admissible extreme loss level \( z^\star \) subject to a
rare chance constraint:
\[
\mathbb{P}(L(u, \xi) \ge z) \le \alpha
\]

where \( \alpha \ll 1 \) (e.g. \( 1\% \), \( 10^{-4} \)).

##  Main Results

- The **OptVaR portfolio** consistently achieves the highest admissible extreme loss threshold
  \( z^\star \), outperforming classical strategies in tail risk regimes.
- Monte Carlo estimates confirm that the large deviations approximation is **conservative**
  and reliable.
- Dominant point analysis reveals that **extreme losses are driven by coherent,
  joint shocks** across AI equities, confirming the **systemic nature of tail risk**.
- Diversification within a single highly correlated sector is shown to be **insufficient**
  to mitigate extreme risk.
